# Computational identification of surface markers for isolating distinct subpopulations from heterogeneous cancer cell populations

This is a set of notebooks/scripts used to process single-cell data and find surface markers for the paper [Computational identification of surface markers for isolating distinct subpopulations from heterogeneous cancer cell populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-024-00441-6). We also released a package for this called `clusterCleaver` with more instructions at https://github.com/brocklab/clusterCleaver. 

An environment for running these scripts can be created using `environment.yml`. 

Processed data available upon request.
